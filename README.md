# Skeleton line labeling algorithm based on linear time component labeling
## introduce
  This is a completely c language implementation of the skeleton line identification program, the program does not rely on other image library to achieve skeleton line identification and image generation.
## blob - a 8-neighbour connected components labelling and contours extractor.

See `blob.h` for a complete documentation.
